# File-Reader
This Python script enables users to read the contents of a text file. By specifying the file path, users can quickly view the file's content directly in the console. If the file is not found at the specified path, the script gracefully handles the error and notifies the user. It's a straightforward tool for efficiently accessing and reviewing text files without manual intervention.
